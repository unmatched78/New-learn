# HRMIS â€“ Django Human Resource Management Information System

A modular, multi-tenant HR platform built with Django and Django REST Framework. Designed for SaaS-style deployment, HRMIS allows organizations (tenants) to pick and choose core HR featuresâ€”such as employee profiles, time tracking, leave management, and payrollâ€”while ensuring complete data isolation per tenant. Built-in tools include JWT authentication, background task processing with Celery/Redis, PostgreSQL schema-based multi-tenancy, and a streamlined developer experience.

   - Background jobs handled by Celery with Redis as broker.  
   - Features scheduled tasks like payroll processing, document expiry checks, and notifications.

6. **Developer Experience Enhancements**  
   - Django Debug Toolbar for performance insights during development.  
   - `shell_plus` from `django-extensions` for interactive model exploration.  
   - Structured code for signals, middleware, audit logging, and shared utilities.
